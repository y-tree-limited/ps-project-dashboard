How to Update the Status Report

This dashboard is a static HTML file. You do not need to be a developer to update it, but you will need a basic text editor (like Notepad, TextEdit, or VS Code).

There are two ways to use this dashboard:

Method 1: The "Quick Fix" (For Meetings)

Best for: Making last-minute changes right before a screenshot.

Open crowdstrike_status.html in your browser.

Click directly on any text. (The page is set to contenteditable).

Type your changes.

Take your screenshot.
⚠️ Note: Refreshing the page will lose these changes. Use Method 2 for permanent updates.

Method 2: Permanent Updates (Code Editing)

Best for: Preparing the report for next week.

Right-click the crowdstrike_status.html file and choose Open With > Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).

1. Changing the Date & Overall Status

Look for the top section <div class="header">.

Date: Change Nov 25, 2025 to today's date.

Status: Change the class status-red to status-green or status-amber to change the color of the pill.

2. Updating Progress Bars

Search for class="timeline-bar". You will see a style attribute controlling the width.

Change Progress: Update width: 20%; to whatever percentage you need.

Change Color: Update background: var(--amber); to --green or --red.

Example:

<!-- Before -->
<div class="timeline-bar" style="width: 20%; background: var(--amber);"></div>

<!-- After (Moved to 50% and Green) -->
<div class="timeline-bar" style="width: 50%; background: var(--green);"></div>


3. Updating Ticket Tables

The tables use standard HTML rows (<tr>) and cells (<td>).
To add a new ticket, copy a block starting with <tr> and ending with </tr> and paste it into the list.

To change a status color:
Look for the <span> class inside the cell:

<span class="task-status ts-done"> = Green (Done)

<span class="task-status ts-progress"> = Blue (In Progress)

<span class="task-status ts-blocked"> = Red (Blocked)

<span class="task-status ts-todo"> = Grey (To Do)

4. Updating "Impact" Boxes

Search for impact-box.

Negative Impact: Use class="impact-box" (Red/Warning).

Neutral Impact: Use class="impact-box-neutral" (Grey/Info).

5. Adding New "Tier 0" Tags

Search for class="tier-tag".

Completed App: Use class="tier-tag tag-done" (Green).

Pending App: Use class="tier-tag tag-todo" (Yellow).

💡 Pro-Tip for VS Code Users

If you use VS Code, install the "Live Server" extension. It allows you to right-click the file and choose "Open with Live Server," so you can see your changes update instantly in the browser as you save the file.
