How to Update the Status Report

This dashboard is a self-contained HTML file. You do not need to be a developer to update it. Most changes can be made directly in the browser.

Method 1: Quick Updates (In-Browser)

Best for: Updating status, colours, and text before a meeting.

1. Editing Text

Click anywhere on the page to edit text directly.

You can rename tasks, update dates, or rewrite descriptions just like in a Word doc.

2. Updating the Timeline

Resize Bars: Click and drag the coloured bar left or right.

Change Colours: Click the Status Text next to the bar (e.g., "Target: Dec 15") to cycle through colours:

Green → Amber → Red → Blue → Grey.

3. Updating Statuses & Pills

Project Status (Top Right): Click the "STATUS: BLOCKED" pill to cycle Red/Amber/Green.

Task Status (In Tables): Click any status pill (e.g., "IN PROGRESS") to cycle colours. Click inside the text to rename it.

Ticket Age: Click the age text (e.g., "2 Months") to cycle severity (Red/Amber/Green).
